                    In January 2018, New College of Florida opened the New College Food Pantry (NCFP). The Food Pantry is in partnership with the Peace Education and Action Center, the Food Bank of Manatee and All Faiths Food Bank. The mission of the NCFP is to support student success by addressing the existence of short-term food insecurity.  Through collaboration across various departments at New College of Florida, student-led research, data collection, and support from campus and local community members, this critical resource provides emergency and supplemental food items of high nutritional value that contribute to the community’s need for access to hunger relief services.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">On- and off-campus students will have access to this resource 24/7 when campus is open. Our Food Pantry is located at X-3150 which is next to the Resident Hall Directors Housing Office in X dorm.</span>
